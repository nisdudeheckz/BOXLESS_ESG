# Boxless ESG â€” Scene Localization Without Explicit Bounding Boxes

Boxless ESG is a modular, interpretable pipeline for **text-based scene localization** that works without explicit bounding boxes in training data.

It takes an **image** and a **natural language query**, and outputs:
- A **mask** of the detected region
- A **narrative crop** for storytelling
- An **evidence JSON** containing all intermediate scores and reasoning
